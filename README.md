# Space-Object-Tracker

## Background to the Study
The Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik 1 began the Space Age in 1957. \cite{1, 2} Over the past 66 years, approximately 6400 rockets have been launched, deploying 15070 satellites into Earth's orbit. When a spacecraft is abandoned, its rocket stages remain in orbit, and if a collision or explosion occurs between these stages or with other satellites or objects, the result is termed a fragmentation event. This is an occurrence in which a larger object breaks apart into smaller pieces or fragments which remain in the Earth's orbit. The population of man-made objects in space that have lost their functionality or purpose, is otherwise known as space debris. The accumulation of space debris is leading to the formation of a belt of debris around Earth \cite{4}, increasing the potential for collisions and endangering operational satellites and spacecraft. To mitigate these risks associated with the growing space population, it is crucial to enhance Space Situational Awareness (SSA). This involves a more thorough mapping of the space environment, by accurately tracking and predicting the precise positions of all space objects. A visual software interface serves as a valuable tool for representing the space environment, enabling astronomers, researchers, and space enthusiasts to assess the space population more effectively and make informed decisions.

## Objectives
This study aims to develop and optimise a software tool capable of modelling space objects, predicting their orbit propagation, and providing a symbolic visualisation of the space environment. The investigation endeavours to research and determine the most appropriate orbit propagation model to predict the trajectories of space objects in the Low Earth Orbit.   This chosen model will be employed to predict the position of a space object at a given date and time, and the developed application will enable simultaneous tracking of multiple space objects. The final objective of the project is to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) which provides a visual representation of the space population. This will enable users to interact with the application and utilise its diverse functionalities. The application must have the capability to present the orbital data associated with each space object. Moreover, the application aims to incorporate a functionality that facilitates the export of Two-Line Elements for selected space objects.

## Scope and Limitations
This study aims to develop an application that tracks and visualises satellites, focusing on their movement and spatial representation. The application is limited to the position estimation of satellites and space debris which are in Earth’s low orbit, and which have publicly available TLE data on Celestrak. It is important to note that the application is not intended for use in scenarios where precise position accuracy is of critical importance. The application will import Two-Line Element (TLE) data from a third-party satellite tracker and extract the necessary control data. The tracking of object positions will occur at regular time intervals, but it should be noted that the data displayed will not be real-time information.

The scope of this study introduces two important limitations. Firstly, satellites with classified information or objects in unconventional orbits may not be trackable through this application. Secondly, the application's functionality is contingent upon a stable internet connection as it relies on retrieving up-to-date TLE data from Celestrak. Furthermore, it is important to note that this application does not provide real-time position tracking data from the space objects themselves, but instead relies on estimated positions which have been calculated using TLE data and SGP4. The accuracy of satellite position estimation is thus dependent on the precision of the TLE data and the inclusion of perturbations within the environmental model. Finally, the performance of the application may be influenced by the processing speed and graphical capabilities of the user's computer. Older or low-powered machines might experience limitations in efficiently running the GUI application.
